There are two main changes to the use of SSpace:

1. Now input 'y' is compulsory, then there is no need to set 'y' every time you set up a model. Example:
   Before:     m = SSmodel('y', y, 'u', u, 'model', @model);
   Now:        m = SSmodel(y, 'u', u, 'model', @model);
   
2. Function SS create that runs SSmodel, SSestim, SSvalidate and SSsmooth sequentially, this saves a lot of tedious repetitive calls to these functions.
